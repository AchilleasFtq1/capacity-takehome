// Package capacity holds the tier rules.
//
// It is pure on purpose: no database, no context, no clock, no IO. Everything
// a decision needs is passed in, which is what makes the rules cheap to test
// and impossible to accidentally scatter across resolvers.
//
// The four rules these functions must satisfy are in the README. Read them there,
